# ðŸ“Š Average LPIPS Score at First Decode Failure

This bar plot shows the **average LPIPS score at the first decode failure** for each attack type across all 15 test images. A higher average LPIPS score indicates that a watermarking method can tolerate more perceptual distortion before failing to decode.

This is useful for comparing methodsâ€™ robustness across different attack types from a perceptual similarity perspective.
