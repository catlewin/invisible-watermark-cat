# ðŸ“Š Noise Threshold Summary

This summary reports the robustness of each watermarking method under threshold-based attacks.
- **Clean Failures**: Number of images where the method failed to decode the original, unattacked watermarked image. These images are excluded from threshold calculations.
- **Attack Failures**: Number of images that failed decoding at all tested attack levels.
- **Threshold Statistics**: Calculated only from images that passed the clean test and at least one attack level. Includes average, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum threshold values observed.

| Method | Images | Clean Failures | Attack Failures | # Valid Thresholds | Avg Threshold | Median | Std Dev | Min | Max |
|--------|--------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|--------|---------|-----|-----|
| dwtDct | 15 | 11 | 11 | 4 | 2.50 | 0.00 | 4.33 | 0.00 | 10.00 |
| dwtDctSvd | 15 | 0 | 0 | 15 | 12.67 | 15.00 | 3.09 | 5.00 | 15.00 |
| rivaGan | 15 | 1 | 1 | 14 | 19.29 | 20.00 | 7.99 | 5.00 | 35.00 |
